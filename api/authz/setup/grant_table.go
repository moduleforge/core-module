// sharedCTEPrefix is the recursive CTE block that appears at the top of every
// GrantTableGenerator-emitted access function body. It walks UP the actor group
// hierarchy from the requesting actor, collects all grants for any of the
// requested operation IDs, and then walks DOWN the target group hierarchy to
// enumerate all leaf target entity IDs accessible by those grants.
//
// The five CTEs are:
//   - ActorChain: the actor plus every group the actor belongs to (transitively).
//   - WildcardAdmin: non-empty (contains a single row) when the actor holds any
//     grant with target_id IS NULL for any operation in p_op_ids. A non-empty
//     WildcardAdmin means the actor can access all rows of the resource.
//   - GrantedTarget: the set of target entities/groups that are directly granted
//     (only for non-wildcard, targeted grants where target_id IS NOT NULL).
//   - TargetChain: all members reachable downward from GrantedTarget.
//
// Each generated body then adds a UNION of:
//  1. The WildcardAdmin arm: returns all rows when WildcardAdmin is non-empty.
//  2. The generic "own" predicate (actor owns the row directly, scoped to the
//     requested type).
//  3. A join against TargetChain to include grant-reachable rows.

// GrantTableGenerator is the Phase 2 production AccessFuncGenerator. It
// replaces AdminOrOwnGenerator with a data-driven approach: grants stored in
// the grants table (potentially via actor/target groups) determine what rows an
// actor can see. The generic "own" clause preserves the same ownership
// semantics that AdminOrOwnGenerator had, without the hard-coded admin check —
// admin access is now handled by the WildcardAdmin CTE, which is non-empty
// when the actor (or any group the actor belongs to) holds a wildcard grant
// row (target_id IS NULL) for the requested operation.
//
// The body is a single generic three-arm UNION parameterized only by the
// runtime type-slug: it selects entities of the requested type via
// type_is_or_descends_from, gated by the wildcard grant, direct ownership, or
// the grant-driven TargetChain. mod-core has no compile-time knowledge of any
// downstream resource table (tags, tasks, authz_*_groups); adding a new
// resource type requires zero changes here.
//
// Two invariants govern the body:
//   - The type predicate (type_is_or_descends_from) appears on EVERY arm,
//     including the own-arm. With ownership centralized on entities.owner_id, an
//     actor may own entities of different types; scoping every arm by type stops
//     one type's rows (e.g. an actor's tags) leaking into another type's access
//     function (e.g. task).
//   - "corporation / authz-group have no self-access" now holds at the DATA
//     layer: those entities keep a NULL owner_id, so the own-arm text is present
//     but matches nothing. The absence of self-access is no longer expressed by
//     omitting SQL, and is verified by DB/integration tests, not SQL-text checks.
//
// Non-Entity dependent data (e.g. contacts) does NOT get its own access
// function; list queries for such data JOIN the parent entity's access function.
